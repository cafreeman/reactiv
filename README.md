# Signalis

`signalis` is a lightweight library for reactivity influenced by [`@preact/signals`](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/), [`solidjs`](https://www.solidjs.com/), and [`reactively`](https://github.com/modderme123/reactively). It aims to expose a small set of highly composable, highly performant primitives for building reactive programs as simply as possible.

For the core reactivity library, see [`@signalis/core`](./packages/core/README.md).

For the React integration, see [`@signalis/react`](./packages/react/README.md).
